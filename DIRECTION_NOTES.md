# Direction Notes

## Tone
The tone of the proposal should be heartfelt and sincere, conveying true emotions without over-dramatization.

## Acting Style
Actors should exhibit a naturalistic style, focusing on genuine reactions and emotional connection rather than theatricality.

## Camera Work
Utilize close-up shots to capture intimate moments and reactions, alternating with wider shots to establish the setting and context of the proposal.

## Music
Soft instrumental music should underscore the proposal, enhancing the emotional weight without overpowering the dialogue.

## Mood Progression
Begin with a serene and hopeful mood, transitioning to a more intense emotional climax during the actual proposal, and concluding with a warm and joyful atmosphere post-acceptance.
